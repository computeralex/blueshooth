# BlueShooth

A macOS menu bar app that gives you control over which Bluetooth devices can auto-connect. Prevent unwanted automatic Bluetooth connections while keeping your devices paired.

## Problem

macOS automatically connects to paired Bluetooth devices when they're in range, which can be annoying when:
- You have multiple Bluetooth speakers/headphones and only want to connect to specific ones
- You want devices paired but not automatically connecting
- You need more granular control over Bluetooth behavior

## Solution

BlueShooth runs in your menu bar and lets you choose which paired devices should NOT auto-connect. Selected devices stay paired but won't connect automatically - you can still connect them manually through System Settings when you want to use them.

## Features

- üéØ **Selective Auto-Connect Control**: Choose which devices can auto-connect
- üîå **Quick Connect/Disconnect**: Connect or disconnect devices directly from the menu bar
- üü¢ **Real-Time Status**: See which devices are currently connected
- üö´ **Automatic Blocking**: Instantly disconnects blocked devices if they try to auto-connect
- üîî **Notifications**: Get notified about connection events
- üì± **Menu Bar Interface**: Quick access to all paired devices
- üíæ **Persistent Settings**: Your preferences are saved between sessions
- üîí **Privacy-Focused**: All settings stored locally, no data collection

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later (for building from source)

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blueshooth.git
   cd blueshooth
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open BlueShooth.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run (‚åòR) or archive for distribution (Product > Archive)

### Option 2: Download Release

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/blueshooth/releases) page.

## Usage

1. **Launch BlueShooth**: The app appears in your menu bar with a Bluetooth antenna icon

2. **View Devices**: Click the menu bar icon to see all paired Bluetooth devices
   - üü¢ = Currently connected
   - ‚ö™Ô∏è = Disconnected

3. **Connect/Disconnect Devices**:
   - Click on any device to open its submenu
   - Choose "Connect" to connect a disconnected device
   - Choose "Disconnect" to disconnect a connected device
   - No need to open System Settings!

4. **Toggle Auto-Connect**:
   - In the device submenu, click the auto-connect option
   - ‚úì Auto-connect: Enabled = Normal macOS behavior
   - üö´ Auto-connect: Disabled = Device will be blocked from auto-connecting

5. **Refresh**: Click "Refresh Devices" to update the device list

## How It Works

BlueShooth provides direct control over Bluetooth connections without opening System Settings. The app:

1. Lists all paired Bluetooth devices with real-time connection status
2. Allows you to connect/disconnect devices programmatically via IOBluetooth
3. Stores your auto-connect preferences locally using UserDefaults
4. Monitors system Bluetooth notifications
5. Disconnects blocked devices immediately when they try to auto-connect
6. Shows notifications for connection events

## Permissions

BlueShooth requires Bluetooth access to:
- List paired devices
- Monitor connection events
- Connect and disconnect devices programmatically

The app will request Bluetooth permissions on first launch.

## Limitations

- Device must remain paired (unpaired devices can't be managed)
- Some Bluetooth devices may not support programmatic connection/disconnection
- Some devices may attempt to reconnect multiple times (the app will continue blocking them)
- Connection success depends on device proximity and Bluetooth stack availability
